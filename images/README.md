# DoubleSpeed Host Logo and Favicon Placeholder

This directory contains placeholder images for the DoubleSpeed Host template.

## Files:
- favicon.ico - Site favicon
- logo.png - Main logo image (if not set in WHMCS)

## Note:
To use a custom logo, upload your logo file and configure it in the WHMCS admin panel under:
Setup > General Settings > General > Logo URL

The template will automatically use either the configured logo or fall back to the logo.png file in this directory.
